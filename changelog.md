# Revision history for skeletal-set

## 0.2.0.0  -- 2018-04-24

* Rename Setoid to Skeletal Set to better represent what this
  data structure is actually is. What we were thinking to be a setoid
  turnd out to be wrong, as we do not implement the setoid in a general
  sense of its definition.

## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-01-17

* Initial extract of Setoid into a standalone library.
