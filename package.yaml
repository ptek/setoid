synopsis:            Skeletal set - a set with equivalence relation different from equality
description:         Skeletal Set is a set equipped with an equivalence relation.
                     It is a useful data structure in cases where equivalence is 
                     chosen not to be equality. One can use it to influence the 
                     memberships of the elements more strictly than in sets, and run
                     computations when conflicts between elements are found.
